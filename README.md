# Nudge

Nudge is an Android-first, local-first productivity app that organizes chores, one-time tasks, and reusable lists, then redirects excessive time in selected distracting apps toward a small useful action.

## Current status

The interactive browser prototype is live and under active feature-by-feature development. The native Android implementation has not started yet.

- [Live interactive prototype](https://arrow2851.github.io/Nudge/)
- [Master project roadmap and progress tracker](PROJECT-STATUS.md)
- [Current product-direction amendments](docs/progress/product-direction-amendments.md)
- [Areas and Sections milestone notes](docs/progress/areas-and-rooms.md)
- [Task and Chore detail milestone notes](docs/progress/task-and-chore-details.md)
- [Tasks checklist milestone notes](docs/progress/tasks-destination.md)
- [Reusable Lists milestone notes](docs/progress/lists-destination.md)

### Implemented prototype slices

- Simplified Today screen with Due Today, Overdue, Lists, Recent Activity, grading, and Undo
- Optional Daily Progress and Quick Win preference flags, both off by default
- Four-destination bottom navigation without a global floating add action
- Areas screen with shipped defaults and template-conditioned House Sections
- Nested Area and Section navigation with contextual task/chore creation
- Due-only Section Reset with completion, grading, skipping, and progress
- Task and Chore details with recurrence-aware Chore behavior
- Single checklist-style Tasks destination
- Reusable Lists collection and list-detail routes
- Shared Task/List item behavior: inline-only creation, tap-to-edit sheets, hold-to-reorder, and swipe-right indentation
- Automatic Main item creation when an item is swiped under the item above
- Main Task and Main List item subitems with thin completion progress
- Parent completion cascades to children; child completion recalculates the parent
- Completed root items move to the bottom
- Show Completed / Hide Completed controls for Tasks and Lists
- Completed children remain visible beneath unfinished parents
- Task-only Due Date and optional gray due shorthand
- List history suggestions during creation and existing-item editing
- Left-side List checkboxes by default with future right-side preference support

## Product pillars

- Areas and optional Sections such as `House > Kitchen`
- Recurring chores with calendar-based or completion-based cadence
- Optional Light, Moderate, and Deep completion grading
- Reusable lists that remember completed items for future suggestions
- A lightweight checklist for one-time tasks
- Direct app-usage intervention with compatibility fallbacks
- Contextual, destination-specific creation flows instead of one global add action
- Widgets, voice, and Gemini-assisted entry where they add real value
- Local-first core functionality with optional cloud features later

## Immediate next step

Review the unified Tasks and Lists interactions after deployment. The next major build milestone is the Direct Intervention prototype: simulated redirect, intervention choices, alternative tasks, Not Now behavior, Focus Mode, and intervention settings/compatibility previews.
