# Nudge

Nudge is an Android-first, local-first productivity app that organizes chores, one-time tasks, and reusable lists, then redirects excessive time in selected distracting apps toward a small useful action.

## Current status

The interactive browser prototype is live and under active feature-by-feature development. The native Android implementation has not started yet.

- [Live interactive prototype](https://arrow2851.github.io/Nudge/)
- [Master project roadmap and progress tracker](PROJECT-STATUS.md)
- [Current product-direction amendments](docs/progress/product-direction-amendments.md)
- [Areas and Sections milestone notes](docs/progress/areas-and-rooms.md)
- [Task and Chore detail milestone notes](docs/progress/task-and-chore-details.md)
- [Tasks destination milestone notes](docs/progress/tasks-destination.md)

### Implemented prototype slices

- Simplified Today screen with Due Today, Overdue, Lists, Recent Activity, grading, and Undo
- Optional Daily Progress and Quick Win preference flags, both off by default
- Four-destination bottom navigation without a global floating add action
- Areas screen with shipped defaults
- Template-conditioned House Sections
- Nested Area and Section detail navigation
- Add and edit Area
- Add and edit Section
- Contextual task/chore creation from an Area or Section
- Due-only Section Reset with completion, grading, skipping, and progress
- Task and Chore detail screens
- Snooze, reschedule, skip occurrence, pause/resume recurrence, reopen, and recurrence-aware completion
- Full Tasks destination with Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Waiting, Blocked, and Completed views
- Tasks-specific creation with status, due date, priority, Area, Section, duration, notes, and Nudge eligibility
- Task search, filtering, sorting, grouping, quick completion, status changes, empty states, and shared detail integration

## Product pillars

- Areas and optional Sections such as `House > Kitchen`
- Recurring chores with calendar-based or completion-based cadence
- Optional Light, Moderate, and Deep completion grading
- Reusable lists that remember completed items for future suggestions
- One-time tasks for repairs, errands, orders, and other TODOs
- Direct app-usage intervention with compatibility fallbacks
- Contextual, destination-specific creation flows instead of one global add action
- Widgets, voice, and Gemini-assisted entry where they add real value
- Local-first core functionality with optional cloud features later
